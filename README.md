# Detecting-AI-Generated-Essays-
This repository provides guidelines and resources for detecting AI-generated essays using Large Language Models (LLMs) for classification. 

## Overview

The detection of AI-generated essays involves leveraging the power of LLMs to classify text as either human-written or machine-generated. By training LLMs on a dataset of both human-written and AI-generated essays, we can develop a robust classification model capable of identifying patterns and characteristics unique to each category.
